                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>

                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                    then
                    try
                    to create simple
                    projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>

                <p></p>

                <h3>How I got started</h3>

                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                    learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                    but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>

                <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was
                    also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
